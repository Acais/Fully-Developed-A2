							<h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
							<p>What does it do?<br>
There are currently no companies that offer a fully autonomous vehicle in which no human interaction is required,
but autonomy in vehicles is something that has been around to some extent for some time now and each and every year more and more features are becoming autonomous.<br><br>
Vehicle autonomy is broken down into levels;<br>
Level 1 - This was first reached in the 50’s and incorporates active cruise control, electronic stability control & ABS.
That’s right, you might not be aware but these are some basic functions of partially autonomous vehicles.<br><br>
Level 2 - Lane-keeping autonomous steering in combination with active cruise control & automatic emergency braking. These first levels are still hands-on-the-wheel functions.<br><br>
Level 3 - Is when there is full automation of all systems, without driver control, in certain situations.
This technology is only allowed to be used on freeways and still often requires driver intervention. (Currently available to the public).<br><br>
Level 4 - Full automation is also part of level 4 but still only in certain situations, it will work almost entirely without driver interaction. (This is where the companies are up to and are testing).<br><br>
Level 5 - Where carmakers of autonomous vehicles are working towards. When this is reached the driver will never need to take over control.<br><br>
There are a few different technologies that allow autonomy to happen in vehicles, apart from a whole suite of software and an array of sensors they will generally use one or a mix of the following technologies;<br>
- LiDAR: Light Detection and Ranging - This is a remote sensing method which uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure variable distances.<br><br>
- RADAR: Radio Detection and Ranging - The method works very similar to Lidar but uses radio waves instead of light waves.<br><br>
- Cameras: This is the most accurate way to create a visual representation of the world around a self-driving car.
Although they have their limitations, as different conditions come into play (rain, fog or nighttime) it starts to become a little more difficult for the cameras to detect objects.<br><br>
- Ultrasonic (SONAR): Sound Navigation and Ranging - These sensors emit short ultrasonic impulses which are reflected by obstacles.
These are currently being used in parking sensors and nearby obstacle detection.<br><br>
Over the next 3 years, almost all companies in the race to full autonomy will be able to show off their cars that are able to navigate city streets at normal speeds.<br><br>
Waymo is currently the leader when it comes to the race to level 5, fully autonomous vehicles whos nearest competitor is General Motors.
Waymo has partnered with Jaguar to develop the world’s first fully self-driving car named Jaguar I-PACE. They started their testing in 2018.
Waymo Driver is also working on learning to drive heavy vehicles such as trucks and semis.<br><br>
With that being said, there is still an argument going around that Tesla is in fact the industry leader when it comes to autonomous
vehicles as they are the most advanced manufacturers that use cameras instead of LiDAR. Cameras are debatably the most accurate sensor to use in autonomous vehicles as it is similar to the human eye.<br><br>
What is the likely impact?<br>
There are many benefits to driverless vehicles or fully autonomous vehicles, some of which are;<br>
Less traffic - Driverless vehicles communicate with their surroundings, that means with each other too.
By communicating with each other they are able to identify the optimal route and help spread demand for scarce road space.<br><br>
Increase in safety - 1.2 million people are killed each and every year in traffic incidents all over the world. In the US alone there is
an expectation that a widespread embrace of fully autonomous vehicles could eliminate 90% of all auto accidents. Not only saving thousands
of lives it will also prevent up to $190 billion in damages and health costs annually.<br><br>
More free time - There was a recent study done in the US and it has shown that the average American spends 101 minutes per day driving.
Thats around 37,935 hours driving over our lifetimes. Imagine what you could get done in that time if your car could drive entirely by itself.<br><br>
Reduced emissions - CO2 emissions from transport have grown 45% globally between 1990 to 2007. Using electric autonomous taxis alone could have a
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 87 to 94% per mile by 2030.<br><br>
This next part is a double edged sword, jobs. Jobs will be lost and jobs will be gained. Driverless cars will leave a huge amount of people jobless,
delivery services, taxis, truck drivers, more than 400,000 jobs are estimated to be impacted in Australia due to self-driving technology.
On the other hand it will create hundreds of thousands of jobs globally in the field of IT, software developers, hi-tech machine experts & wireless network engineers just to name a few.<br><br>
How will this affect you?<br>
I currently use public transport as my main method of transport on a day-to-day basis (to and from work). So for me the benefit would be evening/weekend
drives where I drive up to 3 hours at a time (visiting friends and family). I would be able to study while on the way to visiting my mother or take a video
conference on my way to work (If I had driven to work that day). I think every person in the world will be able to become more productive, if it isn’t similar
to what I have just mentioned, studying or working while driving, it could be catching up on some much needed rest allowing you to be refreshed and get more done throughout the day.<br><br>
As more autonomy is implemented we will soon reach level 5, fully autonomous vehicles and that will also increase the popularity of car pooling/sharing.
Which will lead to fewer cars on the road, less traffic and less stress.<br><br>
The biggest thing for me is the benefit to our earth by using electric autonomous cars. By reducing the amount of CO2 emissions will greatly improve the state of our world.<br><br>
