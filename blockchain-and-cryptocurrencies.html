							<h2>Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies</h2>
							<p style="text-align:justify;">The Technology <br><br>
Block Chain <br>
Block chain is a technology that was initially developed for the use of the online cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
Essentially block chain acts as a timestamp of a transaction in which one (the block), that is attached to an online general ledger (the chain).
This chain of information is stored amongst a variety of computers and networks that can be millions of individuals large.
The ledger that is the block chain can be readily accessed by anyone within the network.
To make the information within the ‘blocks’ private, the chain uses cryptographic data, that links the data to the chain as well as hiding it.
Essentially the owner of the data within the block, belongs to the individual that has placed the block within the chain.
As this information is network distributed, and every user on the chain must have accepted change before it is completed,
it makes the data near impossible to be altered in any way without changing every block. To simplify, this technology has allowed.<br><br>
Cryptocurrency <br>
Cryptocurrencies were initially developed by the unidentified individual/group known as Satoshi Nakamoto.
This individual or group of individuals (Unknown), developed the now ever popular Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies use
the Block chain technology to create an instantaneous transfer of funds, whatever unit they might be, and transfer
directly from one individual to another. The main use for this was to eliminate the middleman that most modern day
companies use in order to transfer funds. Take internet banking for example, when transferring from one person to
another, you must use the banks singular main server, and transfer from there creating not only time lag, but in
the cases of EFTPOS transfers a fee also. Using block chain allows for individuals to immediately transfer the
fund information from one user to another, regardless of how the rest of the chain is operating.<br><br>
Other current Uses:<br>
The innovation of smart contracts, is a growing another application for block chain. The idea allows for individuals
to once again skip out all of the intermediaries that often slow down, clutter, and make transactional contracts a hassle.
The application of smart contracts would allow for 2 parties to agree on an item, ie a property & price, and the block chain
creates all necessary individual contracts, depending on location, price, the individual etc. This technology would not
only simplify, the contract process, but also make the budgeting for new property attainable.<br><br>
Potential Uses:<br>
·        Insurance claim processing <br>
·        Healthcare systems <br>
·        Music sharing systems <br>
·        Asset management and trading <br>
·        Etc.<br><br>
The Future:<br>
There is currently lots of study ongoing for the block chain technology, and where it could take different markets,
such as the finance industry. Using this industry as an example, block chain would eliminate issues such as embezzlement
or fraud, as the trail of funds transferred cannot be altered, and would be clearly identified within the chain.
This technology could also be used to eradicate the need for banks to store funds online, and allow for seamless and
costless transactions between individuals. Issues could arise with the regulation of such an application, although this is
where the area needs further development. Other area’s which could benefit from the use of block chain include renting,
ticketing systems, or ongoing client management systems (CRM).<br><br>
Major Impacts:<br>
As Block chain technology can be used across so many diverse industries, it is hard to pinpoint the exact impact it could have.
But broadly it would create simplification and efficiency across many industries. Due to the ‘smart’ nature of the technology,
it would also create streamlining of resourcing across individual companies. Specifically looking at Cryptocurrency and the
financial industry impacts, block chain could eliminate so many negative ‘grey’ areas that create mistrust towards the industry.
It would also create a financial industry where the need for diverting through to a provider to make monetary or asset based
transactions would be eliminated. With the reduction in the need for intermediaries, customer experience will also be greatly
improved in these areas as they will have full transactional access.<br><br>
If block chain was to expand into other industries, it would also greatly affect globalisation. Take traveling for example,
currently we have companies such as Airbnb who link the host direct to the consumer, but they are limited to the Airbnb server.
Block chain, once established, would allow for a much larger option base, and would eliminate the need for the limiting Airbnb
servers to cooperate. This in turn reducing costs once again for the consumer. The interesting development of block chain could
revolutionise the way that we are able to access international and domestic information, services or consumables.<br><br>
As with any upgrade in technology that streamlines efficiency, there will also be a loss of jobs within certain areas.
As mentioned above, the eradication of the intermediary, although beneficial for the consumer, would also lead to a loss
of employment for the individuals working within those industries. It could bring further job opportunities to the block
chain management, although more than likely this would be a different field entirely for those that could be made redundant.<br><br>
Block Chain and me?<br>
Although the world of block chain and cryptocurrencies is currently reserved for those wanting to take on high risk investments,
or other functions currently in Beta phase testing, the real world applications for block chain are somewhat limited. That being
said they fundamental principles, if introduced into modern day environments, would allow for such a large change in lifestyle and
accessibility for many industries. If intermediary costs go down, there would be greater ease for individuals wanting to purchase
commodities, without having to go through the barriers and costs of multiple handling. Personally I find the financial aspect very
intriguing, as there are so many detrimental factors in today’s oligopolistic set up of financial services. With large banks holding
majority of global funds, and the financial market being impossibly difficult for smaller new firms to enter, block chain would break
down these barriers, whilst also allowing for regulation to be placed around the new operation as of how easy it is to view illegal
behaviour. I know personally when taking into account my close friends and family, the process of transferring money would be
simplistic and streamlined, as you don’t have to wait for the banks processing wait times, or their transfer fees. Instead it
would be instantaneous and free.<br><br>
I think the future of Block Chain will lead to some very interesting developments in the IT world in the coming years.
With so much interest in the area, and constant development by companies/organisations such as Ethereum, a tech based entity that
specialises in real world internet Block Chain applications, the de-centralised possibilities could be endless.</p>
