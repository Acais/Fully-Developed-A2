							<h2>Cyber Security</h2>
							<p style="text-align:justify;">What is cybersecurity? What does it do? What does the future of cybersecurity look like?<br>
Cybersecurity is the practice of defending systems, networks and programs from malicious attacks that compromise the confidentiality,
integrity and/or accessibility of information.<br><br>
Technology surrounds us, from unlocking our front doors and restocking our fridge to the core departments that underpin the social
fabric of our society, i.e. government, finance, health, emergency, transport services. The depth at which people rely on technology,
in both corporate and domestic settings, is only going to increase, and while we’ll see rapid advancements from the present
technological landscape, we’ll also witness rapid advancements in the sophistication and volume of
cybercrime; “Cisco reporting that in 2018, they blocked seven trillion threats on behalf of their customers”,
(Louis Columbus’ Forbes article on ‘Why AI is the Future of cybersecurity’).<br><br>
With respect to corporate environments and consideration of the feedback from a Capgemini Research Institute survey 61% of enterprises
say they cannot detect breach attempts [today] without the use of AI technologies”, and “48% say their budgets for AI in
cybersecurity will increase by an average of 29% in Fiscal Year 2020”, (Louis Columbus’ Forbes article on ‘Why AI is the Future of cybersecurity’).<br><br>
When a business cannot secure data, every day citizens are at risk, not just big business.
If Tesla cannot defend their self-driving cars, we are at risk. If hospitals cannot secure our health records, we are at risk.
If military devices cannot be secured, civilians are at risk. The possibilities of cyber security threats are extensive and inundating.
Therefore, rendering cybersecurity as an essential element of day to day life, in perpetuity.<br><br>
The different types of threats are segmented into a few main categories: ransomware, malware, social engineering and phishing. <br>
Ransomware: Malicious software to deny access to content until a ransom is paid. <br>
Malware: Malicious software for the purposes of unauthorized access and/or causing damage to a computer.<br>
Social Engineering: Manipulating people into revealing confidential information, i.e. passwords, credit card numbers,
PINs, etc. to cause damage or exploit the property and/or service of the authorised user.<br>
Phishing: Fraudulent emails that indeed appear genuine, tricking the recipient into a call for action with the unintended
consequences of granting unauthorised access to another user to cause damage or exploit the property and/or service of the authorised user. <br><br>
Innovations in cybersecurity include, but are not limited to: Biometrics, Multi-Factor authentication, AI and machine learning,
blockchain, IoT technology, cloud technology. <br><br>
Biometrics: verifying someone’s identity by the measurements of their unique physical characteristics, such as fingerprints and iris scans.<br>
Multi-factor authentication: A multi step authentication process that includes two or more of the following..<br>
-Something the user knows (For example: a PIN or answering personal questions like ‘What is your mother’s maiden name?’)<br>
-Something the user has (For example: an SMS one-time PIN, smartcard, reference number)<br>
-Something about the user (For example: biometrics)<br>
AI and Machine Learning: Artificial Intelligence is program created to function like the human brain, which is faster,
more accurate, more objective, with lower energy expenditure. Machine learning is a subset of AI, which is a program that is
designed to learn from the information it’s processed, to become more accurate, more objective and faster in achieving outcomes.
In the area of cybersecurity, AI and machine learning offers the most comprehensive way to detect and respond immediately once
a threat has occurred, and learn from that breach for next time.<br><br>
How and what cybersecurity is used would depend upon a threat model bespoke to the circumstances, i.e. what do you need
to protect and where are your vulnerabilities?<br>
As a more general conclusion, however, AI and machine learning is where the investment and growth is apparent within the
cybersecurity landscape, with major developments likely on the horizon as those already in place ascend themselves. <br><br>
What is the likely impact of cybersecurity?  Who’s affected and will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?<br>
The need for and development in cybersecurity will significantly impact businesses, whether public or private, as corporate structures are
redefined and boundaries once separating departments blur, for example having a separate risk team and cybersecurity team may be considered
superfluous. The pursuit of technological progression to make businesses more agile and secure will come to the foreground as stakeholders
recognise the urgency to protect and secure data, digital assets, business integrity and consumer trust (think areas such as healthcare and finance).<br>
Setting aside the arbitrary relationship of credibility between a business and their clientele, and the research that demonstrates the
financial implications of attacks is amounting to the tune of $26 billion (and growing) to companies worldwide, the upsurge in cybercrime
will have direct effect on stock prices, serving as another huge incentive to invest in measures to prevent, detect and respond to cyber-attacks.<br><br>
Companies are moving beyond Person Identification Number (PINs) to Biometrics and Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) as their primary
defense measures, however, the concern surrounding the authenticity of Russian application FaceApp and a recent article, ‘FBI Issues
Surprise New Cyber Attack Warning: Multi-Factor Authentication Is Being Defeated’ (Zak Doffman, Forbes, 2019) has given rise to anxiety
that, while uncommon, both Biometrics and MFA can be maliciously circumvented. Whereas Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning is
agile enough to lead overall security.<br><br>
Despite the current skills shortage, employment opportunities in cybersecurity will be on the rise, so too will the demand for
candidates who demonstrate competency in the field of IT more generally, as businesses look to streamline. Streamlining will cause a
natural decrease in opportunities and a spike in redundancies affecting roles that once underpinned departments that are disbanding.
Likewise, employees who are unable or unwilling to embrace the necessary changes required of them are at risk of being perceived as a
liability; in the same Forbes article, the FBI urges employers to “increase [the] level of user training”, as research indicates
“99% of cyber-attacks now rely on a person taking action – clicking a link, opening an attachment, falling for a scam” (Zak Doffman, Forbes, 2019).<br><br>
At a domestic level, applications, software, devices, etc. that are used in our day to day functions to set our calendars, pay our bills,
secure our houses, restock our fridges, will all be working behind the scenes to offer customers a seamless experience; like a frog in a
slowly boiling pot of water, the impact of advancements in cybersecurity will largely go unnoticed by the regular person going about their business.<br>
Where people are paying fees to access a service, it would be natural to see these inflate when a company has made an investment with the interest
of their consumers in mind. <br><br>
The benefit of services such as Biometrics and MFA for the average person throughout their daily routine is readily available,
but (as discussed) they come with their own inherent risks, i.e. once your biometrics have been breached you can’t simply grow
a new set of fingerprints. <br><br>
How will cybersecurity affect me, my friends and my family?<br>
Ways in which the developments of cybersecurity affect me in my own life is multifaceted.<br>
My career path is centered around technology, where I’m partly or wholly responsible for the information of other people,
therefore threat developments are something I need to be aware of to maintain a sense of trust between the business and our users. <br>
Likewise, the security of my own information is becoming more vulnerable, particularly concerning social media services.
Giving information to services is something I’m doing frequently, for example government/health or financial services,
often assuming a sense of security without scrutiny, especially with respect to banking.<br>
The threat of vulnerability also exists with the ever increasing opportunity for identity theft. As biometrics becomes
more omnipresent and trusted, it poses a very expansive and serious threat if compromised; what if my whole identity becomes
completely digital in the future such as my passport, certificates, licenses, voting/enrollment etc. and someone could impersonate me digitally?<br>
Furthermore, while seemingly unlikely, there’s the possibility that fraudulent information could cause government services
to perceive something highly illegal about me (https://www.pcworld.com/article/138591/article.html).<br><br>
As mentioned previously, exploits are often executed by means of the victim taking action themselves, which poses as a
serious risk to friends and family members, especially those who are less capable and unfamiliar with technology.
Peers could be seen as an easy exploit, since it would only take some social engineering, by a hacker to bait those I know.<br><br>
