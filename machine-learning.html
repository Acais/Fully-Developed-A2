							<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
							<p style="text-align:justify;">What does it do?<br>
								Machine Learning is exactly what it sounds like. This consists of computers learning how to perform
								tasks based on past experiences, rather than being given a set of instructions. The computer recognises patterns
								and learns how to assign variables that are the same and how to differentiate variables that are not the same.<br><br>
								Machine Learning emerged in 1950 when Alan Turing came up with the concept (Wikipedia Contributors (2019b).
								Alan Turing is recognised as one of the first inventors of the computer, he spoke of a machine that did not need human
								intervention to function, a system that could think independently (Press, G. (2017)). We see that later on; Arthur Samuel
								would create the first Machine Learning programs in 1959 (Wikipedia Contributors (2019b)).<br><br>
								Machine Learning enables the computer to comprehend when something is effective and when something is not,
								this relates to Artificial Intelligence (AI). The core of Machine Learning is based on multiple learning-algorithm
								types including the following;<br>
								- Supervised Learning: enables computers to receive inputs and then assign those inputs to a
								category based on the type of input. Essentially it can determine the difference between inputs because
								it has been taught the differences.<br><br>
								- Unsupervised Learning: This type of Machine Learning is different from supervised learning as the
								computer can differentiate inputs without being taught what makes the inputs different. The computer is given
								inputs and differentiates them based on their data structure, the computer identifies the features of the inputs,
								and orders the data into groups based on their similarities.<br><br>
								- Reinforcement Learning: This is when the computer is given an input but can only define it based on the
								knowledge it already knows; for an example let's say the computer only knows the difference between blonde and
								black hair, so if it was presented with brown hair it would have to determine whether it is closest to blonde or black.
								The computer concludes that the hair is black, the programmer will then correct the computer so that when the
								computer sees brown hair again then it will classify it as brown hair.<br><br>
								Those are all the types of Machine Learning that will be discussed today. A modern-day example of
								Machine Learning is facial recognition software. This is an effective security system that has been made
								possible by Machine Learning. This software uses a camera to recognise the details and structure of a human face.
								Machine Learning is used all over the world; from robotic toys that learn commands, to medical sensors that read
								the status of internal organs. Many software developing companies like Google think that Machine Learning is an
								essential and key part in future technological advancements. On May 7th, 2019 Google displayed new voice assistant software.
								This included a demonstration of someone asking the voice assistant to send an email and then recite the contents of the email.
								The voice assistant recognised what the email was about and was able to set the correct subject of the email and send it
								using only voice commands (Lee, T.B. (2019)).<br><br>
								Machine Learning is often confused with Artificial Intelligence (AI) but they are not entirely the same thing.
								AI enables computers to think and learn similarly to how humans do. Machine Learning is actually a branch of AI
								when a computer receives inputs and tries to think for itself on how to achieve a goal or task. Without the initial
								establishment of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning would not have been created.<br><br>
								What is the likely impact?<br>
								This area of technology will have a great impact on our future and has already had a massive impact on our lives.
								Here are some of the improvements that Machine Learning will bring to our lives;<br>
								- Health: The healthcare industry is being dramatically changed by Machine Learning. These systems are now
								able to assist professional doctors by analysing symptoms of patients in an effective and reliable way. Studies
								have shown that machines can carry out a variety of medical tasks such as predicting allergic reactions, design
								new drugs and formulas, and decrease the chance of incorrect diagnosis.<br><br>
								- Environment: Thanks to Machine Learning we are able to help our environment dynamically. We have the technology
								to detect pollution and identify its source or to analyse potential environmental threats/scenarios.<br><br>
								- Gaming: Machine Learning will enhance gaming in extraordinary ways, it has already had an impact on the
								gaming industry such as a computer learning how to play against a human in chess.<br><br>
								- Security: Home security can now, with the help of Machine Learning technology, be significantly improved
								to make your home even safer and more secure. We already have items such as; cameras and alarm systems, machines
								can now personalise systems in order to provide; voice, facial and fingerprint recognition to analyse visitors.
								This goes even further, in that recognition software can also notify homeowners whether a family member or friend
								has arrived at their house and who it is.<br><br>
								Other changes will be made to society, some people predict that in the future, people will either
								develop and direct machines or machines will direct you. This ‘future’ may result in people losing jobs,
								studies have shown that Machine Learning will provide efficient and fast solutions to many problems in our
								daily lives and can improve many areas of work and industry.<br><br>
								How will this affect you?<br>
								Machine Learning will have a positive and beneficial effect on my day to day life. Let’s say in the near future,
								I experience a medical emergency.  Due to the technological advancements in diagnostics by machines, the medical team
								together with the computer processors/analyses will be able to make a swift and accurate decision on how best to treat my condition.<br><br>
								Gaming is a huge industry today, as a gamer myself, I am excited about the progress being made as machine ‘thought’
								processes become more agile and complex, our experience of gaming will be enriched with more challenging,
								realistic and individual specific content.  Games will cross the divide between pure ‘play’ and learning/education.
								People will be able to develop skills, learn on the job safety, engage in training, etc. in order to prepare themselves
								for specific activities (building a bridge) and with their careers (pilots).<br><br>
								Machine Learning has now at its fingertips, equipment to gather information on pollution, water levels, soil fertility,
								rain patterns, etc. This data can be analysed and used to develop plans and strategies to prevent ecosystem collapse or
								major disasters.  These systems will make man aware of dangers in environmental conditions so that we can live safely
								with less concern about unexpected wild weather, problem pollution and farm in areas more suited to long term sustainability.<br><br>
								Just over a decade ago, security on mobile devices was limited to a simple password or pin, however due to the astonishing
								development in Machine Learning I am now ensured of a safer and more protected experience; I can activate my mobile using
								the biometrics of my face, I can use my fingerprint when accessing important information or components on my laptop because
								the computer has learnt the genetic pattern of my fingertip.<br><br>
								Thanks to these technological developments our daily lives will be dramatically improved. This technology can assist with
								our worldwide safety, health, environmental stability, global economics, law and many other aspects of both life and industry.
								There are endless possibilities with Machine Learning, and I believe it will be the solution to many problems in society
								and will enable us to create a brighter future.<br><br></p>
